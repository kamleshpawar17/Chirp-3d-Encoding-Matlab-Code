This repo contains the code to reproduce results in:

[Pawar K, Chen Z, Zhang J, Shah NJ, Egan GF. Application of compressed sensing using chirp encoded 3D GRE and MPRAGE sequences. International Journal of Imaging Systems and Technology. 2020 Feb 3](https://doi.org/10.1002/ima.22401).

## Installation
Run setup.m to set all the required paths and dependencies. After installation Run the follwong .m files 

## Matlab code files
1. RetrospectiveReconF.m : Code to perform restrospective undersampling and MCS reconstuction on acquired Fouirer encoded invivo k-space data
2. RetrospectiveReconC.m : Code to perform restrospective undersampling and MCS reconstuction on acquired Chirp encoded invivo k-space data
3. ProspectiveReconF.m : Code to perform MCS reconstuction on propectively undersampled Fourier encoded invivo k-space data
4. ProspectiveReconC.m : Code to perform MCS reconstuction on propectively undersampled Chirp encoded invivo k-space data

5. MIP_CS_F: SWI processing and Minimmum intensity projection for accelerated Fourier encoding.
6. MIP_CS_C: SWI processing and Minimmum intensity projection for accelerated Chirp encoding.

The data for running all the codes (1-6) is around (1 GB) and available at: [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FKhOIK9nDyfuqrDC_O8JaxmLYiAF6ESK?usp=sharing)

The raw k-space data (10 GB) is available at: [link](https://monash.figshare.com/articles/Chirp-Encoding-3D-K-Space-Data/7640453)
